## Prereqs

You'll need the latest LTS [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) release installed in order to install these prerequisites.
```sh
$ npm install -g express-generator
$ npm install -g nodemon
```
---
## Setup
### Git
- [Create a new git repository](https://github.com/new) ("example.com")

### Server Setup
- cd into your project (should be obvious by now ;))
    - ```$ cd example.com ```
    - ```$ pwd ```
- Run express generator with the ejs flag
    -  ```$ express --ejs ```
- Install node modules
    - ```$ npm isntall ```
- Start your server to see if it works
    - ```$ nodemon  ```
- If it doesn't immediately break, check out [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your browser to double check everything is running fine

## First Git Push
Before we can push our code to git, we need to create a ".gitignore" file inside the root of our git repo to prevent git from adding the following OS specific code, logs, etc.

```
# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*

# Runtime data
pids
*.pid
*.seed

# Directory for instrumented libs generated by jscoverage/JSCover
lib-cov

# Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul
coverage

# nyc test coverage
.nyc_output

# Grunt intermediate storage (http://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins#storing-task-files)
.grunt

# node-waf configuration
.lock-wscript

# Compiled binary addons (http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html)
build/Release

# Dependency directories
node_modules
jspm_packages

# Optional npm cache directory
.npm

# Optional REPL history
.node_repl_history
```

Once the .gitignore file has been both created and commited to the repository, we can start commiting the rest of our code without worry.
- First commit .gitignore
  - ```$ git add .gitignore```
  - ```$ git commit -m "created .gitignore to filter unwanted nodejs files"```
- Then commit the rest of your code
  - ```$ git add *```
  - ```$ git commit -m "Express server templated generated"```
- Push your commits to GitHub!
  - ```$ git push```
